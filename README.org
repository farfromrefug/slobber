* Slobber
  Slobber is a web service that allows to find and retrieve content
  from [[https://github.com/itkach/slob][slob]] files. Slobber is written in Java.

  To build:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

     # clone slobj and slobber sources
     git clone https://github.com/itkach/slobj.git
     git clone https://github.com/itkach/slobber.git

     #build fat jar in slobber directory
     cd slobber
     ./gradlew uberJar

   #+END_SRC

  To run Slobber from the fat jar and have it serve a slob file located
  at /~/Downloads/enwiki-20230201.slob/:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   java -jar build/libs/slobber-0.11-all.jar ~/Downloads/enwiki-20230201.slob
   #+END_SRC

  By default Slobber listens on port 8013 at 127.0.0.1
  interface. Specify /slobber.port/ Java property to start on a
  different port and /slobber.host/ to start on a different interface.

  To find keys starting with letter A:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   curl "http://localhost:8013/find?key=A"
   #+END_SRC

  Use URLs specified in the return JSON document to retrieve content.
